Android App to help update and maintain the Church's Service and Social schedules

### Church Scheduling

This app is starting out as a way to update the church schedule for Sabbath services. Right now it is put on a single sqlite database. Which is not useful until I can share a database with others that would have the app.

Right now it will let you schedule services and recall them on a calendar.


I would like to add a way to listen to the sermons in a podcast and add a notification for events.
